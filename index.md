#Interaction Hillock Model

### What's the idea?
Graphical Qualitative Categorisation of Social Interactions

## Assumptions

1. These plots show characteristic at ANY GIVEN TIME. Time evolution is yet to be thought of.
2. There are three levels to know somone - L1, L2, L3 - in order of innermost to outermost.
3. The Model shows `how many people know about you to what extent by spending how much time.` This has Model potential to characterise gullibility, Layered personalities, [...and many more to be added in subsequent days.] 
4. Model does not tell anything about self-realisation directly. If someone knows your inner self does not mean the same is in your knowledge too.
